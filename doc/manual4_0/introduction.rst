This online ShakeMap Manual (:ref:`Worden et al., 2017 <worden2017b>`), is 
for ShakeMap version 4.


`ShakeMapÂ® <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/shakemap/>`_, 
developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), facilitates communication of 
earthquake information beyond just magnitude and location. By rapidly mapping out 
earthquake ground motions, ShakeMap portrays the distribution and severity of shaking. 
This information is critical for gauging the extent of the areas affected, determining which areas 
are potentially hardest hit, and allowing for rapid estimation of losses. Key to 
ShakeMap's success, algorithms were developed that take advantage of any high-quality 
recorded ground motions---and any available macroseismic intensity data---to provide 
ground-truth constraints on shaking. Yet ShakeMap also utilizes best practices
for both interpolating recordings and---critically---providing
event-specific estimates of shaking in areas where observations are sparse or nonexistent. Thus, ShakeMap portrays 
the best possible description of shaking by employing a combination of recorded and 
estimated shaking values. 

This Manual provides background on technical aspects of ShakeMap including: 1) information on 
the wide range of products and formats ShakeMap produces, 2) the uses of these products, 
and 3) guidance for ShakeMap developers and operators.
